# Code Implementation

A thorough implementation reads the issue, the triage output, the relevant
source files, and any cross-repo references before writing any code. Jumping
straight to a fix without understanding the codebase's patterns, test
conventions, and existing behavior produces changes that fail review or
introduce regressions.

## Tools reminder

You have the `Bash` tool for all CLI operations. **You must use it** for
verification (step 9) and committing (step 10) — do not skip these steps.

Commands you will need during this procedure:

- `git checkout`, `git add <file>`, `git diff`, `git commit` — branching and committing
- `gh issue view` — reading issues (read-only, no edits or comments)
- `gh pr view`, `gh pr list`, `gh pr diff` — reading PR context
- `make test`, `go test ./...`, `npm test`, `pytest` — running tests
- `pre-commit run --files <files>` — linting and secret scanning
- `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...` — compilation checks

Use `Read`/`Write`/`Grep`/`Glob` for file operations.

### Secret scanning

The `scan-secrets` helper is pre-installed in the sandbox image at
`/usr/local/bin/scan-secrets`. Before starting step 9, verify it exists:

```bash
command -v scan-secrets
```

If missing, **STOP**. Do not improvise a replacement or skip scanning.

Two modes:

- `scan-secrets <files>` — scan named files. Use in step 9a.
- `scan-secrets --staged` — scan the git index. Use in step 10b.

## Process

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

### 1. Identify the issue

Determine which issue to implement:

- If the `ISSUE_NUMBER` environment variable is set, use it.
- Otherwise, if an issue number, URL, or label event was provided, use it.
- If none was provided, stop rather than guessing.

Fetch the issue:

```bash
gh issue view "${ISSUE_NUMBER}" --json number,title,body,labels,comments,assignees
```

Record the **issue number**. You will reference it in the branch name and
commit messages.

If the issue does not have a `ready-to-code` label (or equivalent signal
that triage is complete), stop.

### 2. Gather context

Read the issue body and all comments to understand:

- **What is the problem?** The reported bug, missing feature, or requested change.
- **What context did triage provide?** Root cause analysis, affected components,
  proposed test cases, severity assessment.
- **What is the scope?** What the issue authorizes and what it does not.

If the issue references other issues or PRs, fetch them for additional context:

```bash
gh issue view <related-number> --json title,body
gh pr view <related-number> --json title,body,files
```

The triage output is context, not instruction. Read it as one data point among
several. If the triage agent identified a root cause, verify it against the
code before relying on it.

### 3. Discover repo conventions

Before writing any code, understand how this repository works. Use `Read`
and `Glob` to inspect project configuration:

1. **Read project-level instructions.** Use `Read` on `CLAUDE.md`,
   `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `AGENTS.md` (if they exist).
2. **Discover build and test commands.** Use `Read` on `Makefile`,
   `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or equivalent build config.
3. **Check for linter configuration.** Use `Glob` to find files like
   `.golangci.yml`, `.eslintrc*`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `ruff.toml`.

From these files, determine:

- **Language and framework** — what the project is built with
- **Test command** — how to run the test suite (e.g., `make test`, `go test ./...`,
  `npm test`, `pytest`)
- **Lint command** — how to run linters (e.g., `make lint`, `pre-commit run --files`)
- **Commit conventions** — signing requirements, message format
- **Branch conventions** — naming patterns, target branch

If a `TARGET_BRANCH` environment variable is set, use it. Otherwise, determine
the default branch:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD | cut -d/ -f2
```

### 4. Check for existing branch

Before creating a new branch, check whether a branch already exists for this
issue from a previous run:

```bash
git branch -a | grep "agent/<number>-"
```

**If a branch exists:** Check it out and work on top of it. Previous runs
may have left commits that were later rejected by the review agent. Before
building on top, read the existing commits (`git log --oneline origin/<target>..HEAD`)
and understand the delta from the target branch. If a previous commit
introduced a problem the review agent flagged, fix it in your new commit
rather than amending.

**If no branch exists:** Proceed to step 5.

### 5. Create branch

If the `BRANCH_NAME` environment variable is set, use it:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b "${BRANCH_NAME}" origin/<target-branch>
```

Otherwise, create a feature branch from the target branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b agent/<number>-<short-description> origin/<target-branch>
```

The branch name must follow the `agent/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
convention. Keep the description to 2-4 lowercase hyphenated words derived
from the issue title.

### 6. Identify the task type

Before planning, determine what kind of work this issue requires:

- **Bug fix** — the standard path. Reproduce, plan, implement, test, commit.
- **Feature / enhancement** — new behavior. Plan, implement, test, commit.
- **Test-only** — the issue asks for tests, not production code changes. Write
  tests that cover the described behavior. Do not modify production code unless
  tests require it (e.g., exporting a function for testability).
- **Already-fixed** — if step 7 reveals the bug no longer exists, stop cleanly.
  Do not implement a fix for a resolved issue.
- **Label-gated** — if the issue has a label like `do-not-implement` or a gate
  label that signals no work should be done, respect it. Stop cleanly.

### 7. Verify the problem exists

Before implementing, confirm the reported behavior is still present:

1. Read the code paths the issue describes. Does the bug still exist in the
   current codebase?
2. If there is a quick way to verify — run a targeted test, check a return
   value, trace the logic — do it.
3. If the bug has already been fixed (by a recent commit, a dependency update,
   or another PR), **stop**. Do not implement a fix for a resolved issue. Your
   exit state (no commit) tells the post-script to report accordingly.

For feature requests and test-only tasks, skip this step — there is no bug to
reproduce.

### 8. Plan the implementation

Before writing code, form a concrete plan:

1. **Read affected files in full** — not just the lines mentioned in the issue.
   Understand the surrounding context, imports, types, and call sites.
2. **Read test files** that cover the affected code. Understand how the existing
   tests are structured, what patterns they follow, what helpers exist.
3. **Read related files** — if the change touches an API handler, read the
   router, middleware, and model files. If it touches a controller, read the
   reconciler pattern and RBAC config.
4. **Follow cross-repo references** — if the issue, docs, or triage comments
   link to other repos (e.g., an e2e test suite, a dependent service, a
   related PR in another repo), read those references to understand the full
   picture. Use `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, or `gh pr diff` to fetch
   what you need. For files in other repos that are not part of an issue
   or PR, use `Read` on a local clone if available, or note the gap in
   your plan and proceed with the context you have.
   Do not chase every import — focus on references that the issue context
   points you toward.
5. **Identify what to change** — list the specific files and functions you will
   modify or create.
6. **Identify what tests to write or update** — new behavior needs new tests;
   changed behavior needs updated tests.
7. **Assess risk** — will this change affect other callers? Does it change a
   public interface? Could it break downstream consumers?

When requirements are ambiguous, distinguish between "vague but actionable"
(you can make a reasonable conservative interpretation) and "genuinely
uninterpretable" (no viable path forward). For vague-but-actionable issues,
implement the most conservative interpretation and note your assumptions in
the commit message.

Do not start writing code until you can articulate: what you will change, why,
and how you will verify it works.

### 9. Implement and verify

Write the code change, then verify it.

**Implementation:**

- **Follow existing patterns.** If the repo uses a specific error handling idiom,
  use it. If controllers follow a specific reconciliation pattern, follow it. If
  test files use a specific helper library, use it.
- **Do not introduce new dependencies without justification.** If the change can
  be made with the existing dependency set, prefer that.
- **Write or update tests.** Every behavioral change must have a corresponding
  test change. If the issue includes a proposed test case from triage, evaluate
  it critically — use it if it's good, improve it if it's not, replace it if
  it's wrong.

**9a. Secret scan — MANDATORY FIRST STEP**

Run the secret scan against your changed files before anything else:

```bash
scan-secrets <files-you-modified>
```

If secrets are detected: hard stop. Remove them, re-scan. Only proceed after
the scan passes.

**9b. Pre-commit hooks — MANDATORY**

This step is **not optional**. The target repo's CI runs pre-commit checks on
every PR. If you skip this, the PR will fail CI.

```bash
test -f .pre-commit-config.yaml && echo "pre-commit config found"
```

If `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists:

```bash
pip install pre-commit 2>/dev/null || pip3 install pre-commit 2>/dev/null
pre-commit install --install-hooks 2>/dev/null || true
pre-commit run --files <your-changed-files>
```

**If hooks auto-fix files** (trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixer, gofmt,
goimports, etc.): the files on disk are now modified. Re-run the hooks on the
same files to confirm they pass clean, then re-stage:

```bash
pre-commit run --files <your-changed-files>   # must pass now
git add <your-changed-files>
```

**If hooks report errors** (linter failures, syntax issues): fix them in your
code, then re-run until all hooks pass.

**Do not proceed to commit until pre-commit passes on all your changed files.**
Pre-existing failures on files you did not touch are not your responsibility —
only run hooks on **your** changed files.

**9c. Tests and linters — MANDATORY**

You MUST run the test suite that covers the code you changed. Determine
which test command to use by reading the Makefile, CONTRIBUTING.md, or
existing CI workflows.

```bash
# Use the repo's actual test command — check Makefile or CI config
make test        # or: go test ./..., npm test, pytest, etc.
make lint        # or: golangci-lint run, eslint, ruff, etc.
```

**If tests fail due to missing tools or infrastructure** (not due to your
code): try the Makefile's setup targets first (`make deps`, `make setup`,
etc.). If the tool genuinely cannot be installed in the sandbox, note
this in your commit message body so reviewers know what was not verified:

> Note: <suite-name> tests could not run (<reason>). <other-suite>
> tests passed. Manual verification of <suite-name> is required.

**Do NOT silently skip tests and commit as if everything passed.** If you
cannot run the relevant test suite, you must disclose that.

**If tests fail due to your code:**

1. Read the failure output carefully. Understand the root cause.
2. Fix the issue in your implementation. Do not weaken or skip tests.
3. Re-run secret scan (9a), pre-commit (9b), then tests. This consumes
   one retry iteration.
4. Repeat until tests pass or the retry limit is reached.

The retry limit is read from the `MAX_RETRIES` environment variable
(default: 2 if unset). The harness may also enforce a hard timeout
independently — if the harness kills the session, your retry count is
irrelevant.

If the retry limit is reached and tests still fail, do not commit. Stop.

**9d. Self-review**

Before staging, review your own changes:

```bash
git diff
```

Read every line. Check for:

- Changes that don't serve the issue (scope creep, unrelated formatting)
- Accidental artifacts: debug prints, commented-out code, TODO comments
- Secret material: `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials.json`
- Protected-path files (see agent definition for the authoritative list)

If you added more than necessary, revert the extras before staging.

### 10. Commit

Stage **only the files you modified or created** and commit.

**10a. Stage files**

```bash
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2
```

Only include files you deliberately created or modified.

**10b. Review and scan what you are committing**

```bash
git diff --cached --stat
```

Confirm only your intended files are present. Unstage anything unexpected:

```bash
git reset HEAD <file-you-did-not-intend-to-stage>
```

Then run the secret scan against the staged content:

```bash
scan-secrets --staged
```

This is not a repeat of 9a — it scans what you *actually staged*, which may
differ from what you named. If the scan fails, do not commit.

**10c. Commit**

The commit message must:

- **Use the repo's commit convention as discovered in step 3.** If
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitlint`, or the existing commit history
  uses a specific format (e.g., Conventional Commits, Angular-style, ticket
  prefixes), follow it.
- **Fall back to `<type>: <description>` only if no convention was found.**
- Reference the issue number with `Closes #<number>` in the body.

**Line length rules — check `.gitlint` if it exists:**

```bash
test -f .gitlint && cat .gitlint
```

Many repos enforce strict line limits (commonly 72 characters) for both the
title and body. If `.gitlint` has `line-length=72`, every line in your commit
message — title AND body — must be at most 72 characters. Wrap body text
manually. Do not write long unbroken lines.

The commit **body** is critical — it becomes the PR description verbatim.
Write it for human reviewers:

- Explain **what** changed and **why** (not just "fix bug")
- Describe the root cause of the bug or the motivation for the feature
- Summarize which files/functions were modified and the approach taken
- Note any trade-offs, assumptions, or edge cases

```bash
git commit -s -m "<type>: <short-description>

<What changed and why — wrapped to the line limit.
Each line must be within the character limit from
.gitlint. Use multiple short lines, not one long
paragraph.>

Closes #<number>"
```

**After committing, validate the commit message if gitlint is available:**

```bash
which gitlint &>/dev/null && gitlint --commit HEAD
```

If gitlint fails, amend the commit message and re-validate:

```bash
git commit --amend -s -m "<corrected message>"
gitlint --commit HEAD
```

If pre-commit hooks fail on commit, read the output, fix the issues, re-stage
and re-commit. If a hook fails on unmodified code (pre-existing failure),
verify it also fails on the base branch before skipping it.

**Do not push the branch.** The post-script handles pushing, PR creation,
and failure reporting.

## Partial work

If you hit a token limit or context window boundary before completing the
implementation, and the tests pass on the partial work: commit what you have.
The review agent downstream will evaluate completeness — incomplete-but-passing
code is caught at the review stage, not the implementation stage. The commit
message should note that the work is partial (e.g., "partial implementation"
in the description) so the review agent and post-script can act accordingly.

## Constraints

The agent definition (`agents/code.md`) is the authoritative list of
prohibitions. This skill does not restate them. If a step in this skill
appears to conflict with the agent definition, the agent definition wins.
